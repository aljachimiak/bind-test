				<h2>What is React.JS?</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<p>React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces by Facebook and Instagram. Many people choose to think of React as the V in MVC.</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>We [facebook engineering team] built React to solve one problem: building large applications with data that changes over time.</p> 
				</blockquote>

			<section>
				<h2>What does React do?</h2>
				<p>React uses a concept called the Virtual DOM that selectively renders subtrees of nodes based upon state changes. </p><br><br><p>It does the least amount of DOM manipulation possible in order to keep your view up to date.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>How?</h3>
				<p>Imagine you had an object that you modeled around a real person. <br><br>The object has every relevant property a person could possibly have, and mirrored the persons current state. This is basically what React does with the DOM when it creates a Virtual DOM.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p><small>Now think about if you took that object and made some changes to the state of the object. Added a mustache, some sweet biceps and Steve Buscemi eyes.</small></p>

								<li>React runs a “diffing” algorithm, which identifies what has changed. </li>
								<li>Reconciliation, where it updates the DOM with the results of diff.</li>
